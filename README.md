# Memory Matching Game

## Goal

to create a memory matching card game, with React and Three.js(Three Fiber). Building an animated(mousemove opposite direction with ease) Three.js Home page, to explain the rules, and a button which takes us to the actual page, using React Router as the project has to be an SPA.

## Problems during development

The majority of my time was spent with React Three Fiber... It was a challenge to convert gltf models to jsx components, let alone import them into my project. The actual task wasn't hard, but it was challenging. :)

## Getting Started

### Live version:

-

- to fork the project you habe to clone the repository:

```console
 git clone git@github.com:pozsegam/PMemory.git
```

- now you are free to start the development server with:

```console

```
